### GA WDI DC April 2014, Project 1

### Overview

**Pokemon Live** is a real-time game for the Spring 2014 Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly DC.

The application allows users (trainers) to interact directly with one another in the battle preperation (lobby) area. Trainers can communicate in an open chat format, and challenge one another to duels. These duels take place in the pokemon battlefield and consist of a single-pokemon battle between trainers at random. Users combine a series of attacks, which deplete the health of their opponent. A winner is decided once a user's health has been depleted.
